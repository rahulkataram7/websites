# JavaScript Restaurant Website

> From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page)

The restaurant website is a single page application created using ES6 modules, npm and Webpack. The website uses factory functions to minimise code repetition and ES6 modules to create more modular code. The HTML and CSS design for the website is basic but the JavaScript code is much cleaner than earlier projects.
